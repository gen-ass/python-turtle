# Python Turtle
Drawing graphics using the turtle import library. The turtle programme comes from the original work in 1966 by Wally Feurzig and Seymour Papert. it was originally designed for kids to start programming.
Amazing though! You can read more on it here: https://docs.python.org/2/library/turtle.html.

The python-three-turtles file uses the for and while loops to draw three consecutive shapes.

The programme can still be downloaded and played: http://pythonturtle.org/
